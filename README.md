# cpp_trade_engine
A low-latency limit order matching engine implemented in C++, designed to simulate the core of a modern electronic exchange. The system maintains an in-memory order book with price-time priority, processes buy and sell orders deterministically, and measures end-to-end latency with a focus on microsecond-level performance.
